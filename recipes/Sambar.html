    <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <li><strong>Preparing the Dal:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Wash the toor dal thoroughly and pressure cook it with enough water until it's soft and mushy. Set aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Preparing Tamarind Extract:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Soak tamarind in warm water and extract the pulp. Discard the seeds and fiber, and keep the tamarind extract aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cooking Vegetables:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large pot, add the chopped mixed vegetables, eggplant, turmeric powder, and salt. Cook them with enough water until they are tender. Set aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Preparing the Sambar:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat coconut oil in a separate pan. Add mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds. When they start to splutter, add dried red chilies, asafoetida, and curry leaves.</li>

                <li>Combine the cooked dal and tamarind extract with this mixture. Stir well and let it simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the cooked vegetables along with the water they were cooked in. Adjust the consistency by adding more water if needed.</li>
                <li>Let the sambar simmer for another 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
                <li>Adjust salt and spice levels according to your taste.</li>
