    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinating the Beef:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the beef pieces with turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt.</li>
                <li>Mix well, ensuring the beef is evenly coated with the spices.</li>
                <li>Allow the beef to marinate for at least 30 minutes or longer in the refrigerator.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cooking the Beef:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat coconut oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan or a pressure cooker over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds. When they start to splutter, add the cinnamon stick, cloves, green cardamom pods, dried red chilies, and black peppercorns. Sauté for a minute until aromatic.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onions and curry leaves. Sauté until the onions turn golden brown.</li>
                <li>Add minced ginger and garlic, and sauté for another 2-3 minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
                <li>Add the marinated beef and sear it on all sides until it's browned.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Spices and Tomatoes:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Stir in coriander powder, fennel seeds, and cumin seeds. Cook for a couple of minutes until the spices are fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and the oil starts to separate.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Pressure Cooking (Optional):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If using a pressure cooker, add water and pressure cook the beef for about 3-4 whistles until it's tender. Release the pressure naturally.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Simmer and Finish:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If not using a pressure cooker, add water to the pan, cover, and simmer the beef for about 45 minutes to 1 hour or until it becomes tender.</li>
                <li>Once the beef is tender, add green chilies, garam masala, and thick coconut milk. Stir well and let it simmer for another 10-15 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Adjust the salt as needed, garnish with fresh coriander leaves, and remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Serve your Kerala style beef curry hot with steamed rice, appam, or paratha for a delightful South Indian meal.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
